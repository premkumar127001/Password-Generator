## 🧠 Password Strength Logic

The app checks for:
- Length  
- Uppercase & lowercase characters  
- Numbers & symbols  
- Weak/common password patterns (like `password123`, `admin`, etc.)  

If a generated password matches a **weak pattern**, the generator automatically retries until a strong one is created.
